# B2B Audience Signal Audit

Use the shared quality bar in `../references/output-standard.md` and `../references/skill-design-principles.md` when those files are available.

## Use this skill when

- the user asks for help with b2b audience signal audit in B2B lead generation.
- the user provides data, screenshots, exports, notes or a URL related to b2b audience signal audit.
- the user needs an approval-ready diagnosis before changing campaigns, pages, tracking, CRM or follow-up.

Do not use this skill for a generic brainstorming request. Use it when there is a concrete asset, setup, report, page, funnel, tracking issue or decision to diagnose.

## Required input

- business model, ICP, offer, ACV or deal value range, sales cycle and main conversion goal.
- ad, landing page, lead form, CRM, call note, email or campaign data relevant to this diagnostic.
- time window, traffic source, lead volume and downstream outcomes where available.
- what decision the user is trying to make next: create, fix, scale, pause, brief sales or investigate.
- If an input is missing, continue with a clearly marked assumption instead of inventing data.

## Analysis workflow

1. List current audience signals: job titles, seniority, industries, company size, intent, exclusions, lookalikes and remarketing.
2. Map each signal to the buying committee role it is supposed to reach: decision maker, operator, influencer or researcher.
3. Compare audience signals with CRM outcomes and sales rejection patterns.
4. Flag broad signals that generate volume without qualification and narrow signals that may block high-value accounts.
5. Recommend audience cleanup, segmentation, exclusions or CRM-backed validation before scaling.

## Decision rules

- If the data does not connect to revenue, pipeline, qualified leads or conversion quality, label the recommendation as a hypothesis.
- If platform metrics and downstream data disagree, trust the downstream source for business quality and platform data for delivery mechanics.
- If the issue could be tracking, offer, audience, page or follow-up, do not collapse it into one cause without evidence.
- Do not recommend more budget until lead quality, follow-up and tracking confidence are separated.

## Output format

| Finding | Evidence | Lead quality impact | Recommended action | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Specific diagnostic claim | Data, screenshot, report, note or missing-data marker | Business or signal consequence | Smallest useful next step and owner | High / Medium / Low |

End with:

- `Decision:` fix / test / monitor / ask for data / do not act yet
- `Approval needed:` yes/no and what would change if approved
- `Missing data:` only the inputs that would materially change the recommendation

## Practical example

User: "Can you check this b2b audience signal audit before we make a change?"

Assistant should: ask for or use the relevant exports/screenshots/notes, run the workflow above, produce a ranked diagnostic table, and stop at approval-ready recommendations.

## Guardrails

- Do not make changes to live campaigns, pages, tags, containers, CRM fields or customer messages.
- Do not claim performance impact without evidence.
- Mark missing data clearly.
- Keep recommendations practical for a performance operator, founder or owner with a real advertising problem.
